LarryPerms is a permissions plugin for Minecraft servers. It allows server admins to control what features players can use by creating groups and assigning permissions.

The latest downloads, wiki & other useful links can't be found anywhere.

It is:

* **slow** - modified by some stupid person.
* **untested** - I literally haven't tested this.
* **hard to use** - setup permissions using commands. That's it.
* **free** - available for download and usage at no cost, and permissively licensed so it can remain free forever.

## Building
LarryPerms uses Gradle to handle dependencies & building.

#### Requirements
* Be Larry.
